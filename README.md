# MechIR

## An IR Library for Mechanistic Interpretability

Heavily inspired by the paper **Axiomatic Causal Interventions for Reverse Engineering Relevance Computation in Neural Retrieval Models** by Catherine Chen, Jack Merullo, and Carsten Eickhoff (Brown University, University of TÃ¼bingen), their original code can be found [here](https://github.com/catherineschen/axiomatic-ir-interventions/tree/main)

## Demonstration

Primary files can be found in the /notebooks folder. If you use our live versions and want to run our experiments make sure to choose a GPU instance of Colab. You can easily change our notebook to observe different behaviour so try your own experiments!

## Installation

### Latest Release (Unstable)
```
pip install git+https://github.com/Parry-Parry/MechIR.git
```

### PyPI (Stable)
```
pip install mechir
```

## Usage

### Models 

Currently we support common bi- and cross-encoder models for neural retrieval. The following models are available:

* Dot: A simple dot-product model allowing multiple forms of pooling
* Cat: A cross-encoder model with joint query-document embeddings and a linear classification head
* MonoT5: A sequence-to-sequence cross-encoder model based on T5

To load a model, for example TAS-B, you can use the following code:

```
from mechir import Dot

model = Dot('sebastian-hofstaetter/distilbert-dot-tas_b-b256-msmarco')
```

### Datasets and Perturbations 

To probe model behaviour we need queries and documents, we retrieve these from ir-datasets though you can use your own (MechDataset). To load an IR dataset, for example MS MARCO, you can use the following code:

```
from mechir import MechIRDataset

dataset = MechIRDataset('msmarco-passage/dev')
```

The second step of probing is to create a perturbation of text to observe how model behaviour changes, we can do this simply with the perturbation decorator:

```
from mechir.perturb import perturbation

@perturbation
def my_perturbation(text):
    return text + "MechIR"
```

We can then apply this perturbation efficiently using our dataset and a torch dataloader

```
from torch.utils.data import DataLoader
from mechir.data import DotDataCollator

collate_fn = DotDataCollator(model.tokenizer, transformation_fun=my_perturbation)
dataloader = DataLoader(dataset, collate_fn=collate_fn, batch_size=8)
```
