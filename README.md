# MechIR

## An IR Library for Mechanistic Interpretability

Heavily inspired by the paper **Axiomatic Causal Interventions for Reverse Engineering Relevance Computation in Neural Retrieval Models** by Catherine Chen, Jack Merullo, and Carsten Eickhoff (Brown University, University of TÃ¼bingen), their original code can be found [here](https://github.com/catherineschen/axiomatic-ir-interventions/tree/main)

* experiment.ipynb: This notebook demonstrates how to use the MechIR library to perform activation patching on a simple neural retrieval model. 
* activation_patching_considerations.ipynb: This notebook provides a more in-depth look at the activation patching process and the considerations that go into it.
