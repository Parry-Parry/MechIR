## An IR Library for Mechanistic Interpretability

Heavily inspired by the paper **Axiomatic Causal Interventions for Reverse Engineering Relevance Computation in Neural Retrieval Models** by Catherine Chen, Jack Merullo, and Carsten Eickhoff (Brown University, University of TÃ¼bingen), their original code can be found [here](https://github.com/catherineschen/axiomatic-ir-interventions/tree/main)
