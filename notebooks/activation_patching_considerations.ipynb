    "# Considerations for Activation Patching in IR\n",
    "\n",
    "In our main demo notebook, we show an example for activation patching individual attention heads to demonstrate the workflow of an end-to-end pipeline. However, there are several factors to consider when designing activation patching experiments (see [Zhang and Nanda](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2309.16042) on best practices for activation patching for NLG tasks). Specifically, researchers should carefully consider (1) the type of perturbations used when creating input pairs for patching and (2) the evaluation metric used to assess patching results.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we provide an overview of the these \"hyperparameters\" in the context of activation patching in IR, along with some observational insights from our experiences. We leave empirical evaluation of these considertions for future work."

    "## Activation Patching\n",
    "\n",
    "### Setup and Evaluation\n",
    "\n",
    "Activation patching consists of three forward passes through the model:\n",
    "1. Baseline run\n",
    "2. Perturbed run\n",
    "3. Patched run\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember in the previous section when we wanted to know the effect of the perturbation on the original input, specifically whether the *perturbed* or *baseline* input had the higher relevance score? Now that information will come into play, determining which \"direction\" we will perform activation patching, and what information we need to store in runs (1) and (2).\n",
    "\n",
    "The \"append\" and \"prepend\" perturbations both caused an average higher relevance score on the original inputs. So our three runs will looks as follows:\n",
    "1. Baseline run - run the model on the baseline inputs, recording the final relevance scores.\n",
    "2. Perturbed run - run the model on the perturbed inputs, **caching the activations**, and recording the final relevance scores.\n",
    "3. Patched run - run the model on the baseline inputs, **swapping in the cached activations from run (2) on components of interest**, and recording the final relevance scores.\n",
    "\n",
    "To evaluate the effect of a patch and determine which component(s) are responsible for the difference in model behavior, we examine the final relevance scores from the patched run (3). The exact equation we use for the patching metric is shown below, but the intuition is as follows:\n",
    "- If a component is important, then when we patch it in in run (3), the final relevance score should increase significantly toward the score on the perturbed run (2).\n",
    "- If a component is not important, then it should not have any impact on the final relevance score when we patch it in in run (3), and the final relevance score would equal the score on the baseline run (1).\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\frac{\\text{patched\\_score} - \\text{baseline\\_score}}{\\text{perturbed\\_score} - \\text{baseline\\_score}}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "We normalize the metric such that a score of 0 indicates the patch had no effect (i.e., patched_score == baseline_score), a score of 1 indicates a significant component (i.e., patched_score == perturbed_score), and that a negative score indicates a negative component (i.e., patching in that component caused the relevance to decrease).\n",
    "\n",
    "However, using the difference in relevance score is not the only choice we have for our patching evaluation metric. For activation patching on generative decoder-based language models, **logit difference** is often used as the evaluation metric, and thus, for IR models that use logits for the final relevance score (i.e., cross-encoders), we may want to consider using the difference in logits instead of difference in relevance scores."
