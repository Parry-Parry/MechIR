In one study, people younger than 50 years of age with shingles were treated with Valtrex within three days of the beginning of a rash. In people who were not treated with the drug, it took three days for the formation of new blisters to stop. For the people who were treated with Valtrex, the blisters stopped forming one day sooner. The drug will not, however, change the length or severity of postherpetic neuralgia, which is severe pain that can occur after the shingles rash has healed. Valtrex is also not a cure for shingles.

1115210	7416526	5.7895	More information about: Radar. Radar is an object-detection system that uses radio waves to determine the range, angle, or velocity of objects. It can be used to detect aircraft, ships, spacecraft, guided missiles, motor vehicles, weather formations, and terrain. A radar transmits radio waves or microwaves that reflect from any object in their path. A receive radar, which is typically the same system as the transmit radar, receives and processes these reflected waves to determine properties of the object(s).	More information about: Radar.

The presence of introns is thought to assist gene regulation by way of complex methods like alternative splicing. After splicing, a 5' cap and a poly(A) tail are added, and this 'final draft' is called mature mRNA. Splicing, capping, and tailing comprise RNA processing in the nucleus. Once the mature mRNA moves into the cytoplasm, it begins translation and undergoes other forms of gene regulation.

A deal in which the car is sold for $12,500 would be Pareto efficient because both the seller and the buyer are better off as a result of the trade. In this case, they are better off by the same amount: $2,500. However, any price between $10,000 and $15,000 is Pareto efficient because the seller receives more value in money than the value he places on the car, and the buyer values the car more than the money he pays for it. Pareto efficiency has applications in game theory, multicriteria decisionmaking, engineering, and many of the social sciences. It is a central principle in economics. In general, an economic allocation problem has several possible Pareto efficient outcomes. In the marketplace, the competitive equilibrium is typically included among them.

Trees have narrow vessels and tracheids so that water filters slowly up the tree. This indeed is less efficient at carrying water, but wider vessels are more likely to cavitate. In a woody plant, the trunk is almost entirely composed of vessels and tracheids. Tracheids differ from vessels in being much narrower part	tracheids are part of _____.	2

The process by which DNA is used as a template to create mRNA is called transcription. This mRNA then undergoes a further process called translation where the mRNA is used to synthesize proteins, via another type of molecule called transfer RNA.

Exome sequencing is a technique for sequencing all the protein-coding genes in a genome (known as the exome).It consists of first selecting only the subset of DNA that encodes proteins (known as exons), and then sequencing that DNA using any high throughput DNA sequencing technology.xome sequencing is especially effective in the study of rare Mendelian diseases, because it is the most efficient way to identify the genetic variants in all of an individual's genes.

The medical term for an abnormally large thyroid gland is goiter. Some goiters are diffuse, meaning that the whole gland is large. Other goiters are nodular, meaning that the gland is large and has one or more nodules (bumps) in it. There are many reasons the thyroid gland might be larger than usual, and most of the time it is not cancer.	Benign thyroid enlargement and nodules.

Hydrogen is the lightest, simplest and most commonly found chemical element in the Universe, making up around 75% of its elemental mass. Hydrogen is found in large amounts in giant gas planets and stars, it plays a key role in powering stars through fusion reactions.Hydrogen is one of two important elements found in water (H 2 O). Each molecule of water is made up of two hydrogen atoms bonded to one oxygen atom.In 1766, during an acid metal reaction, Henry Cavendish first formally recognized hydrogen.In 1781 he also found that hydrogen produces water when burned.ydrogen can exist as a liquid under high pressure and an extremely low temperature of 20.28 kelvin (−252.87°C, −423.17 °F). Hydrogen is often stored in this way as liquid hydrogen takes up less space than hydrogen in its normal gas form. Liquid hydrogen is also used as a rocket fuel. liquid	hydrogen is a liquid below what temperature	3
