In a bone marrow transplant, doctors infuse or inject healthy stem cells into your body to renew and repair tissue. After your bone marrow transplant, you may notice some minor side effects, such as a flushed face or nausea, due to the preservatives used to freeze the stem cells. bmt	define bmt medical	1

Bone marrow stem cells turn into red blood cells, white blood cells, or platelets to help your body stay healthy. If your bone marrow is damaged or destroyed, it can no longer make normal blood cells. In a stem cell transplant, healthy stem cells are placed in your body through an IV to help your bone marrow start to work right. When the stem cells come from another person, it is called an allogeneic transplant.	Most stem cells are in your bone marrow. You also have some that circulate from your marrow into your blood.

A typical eukaryotic gene, therefore, consists of a set of sequences that appear in mature mRNA (called exons) interrupted by introns. The regions between genes are likewise not expressed, but may help with chromatin assembly, contain promoters, and so forth. See Figure 1.

But only a small percentage — 1.5 percent — of those letters are actually translated into proteins, the functional players in the body. The “exome” consists of all the genome’s exons, which are the coding portions of genes. The term exon was derived from “EXpressed regiON,” since these are the regions that get translated, or expressed as proteins, as opposed to the intron, or “INTRagenic regiON” which is not represented in the final protein.

Its length m is equal to the average of the lengths of the bases a and b of the trapezoid,n obtuse trapezoid with two pairs of parallel sides is a parallelogram. A parallelogram has central 2-fold rotational symmetry (or point reflection symmetry). There is some disagreement whether parallelograms, which have two pairs of parallel sides, should be regarded as trapezoids.

1122767	884946	0.24840546	L-lysine is an essential amino acid used by the body as a building block for many functions important to growth and maintenance of health. L-lysine is an amino acid (a building block of protein) that is essential for health. However, it cannot be manufactured naturally in the human body like other types of amino acids. Therefore, L-lysine, also called lysine, is considered as one of the eight essential amino acids. In order to obtain lysine, one has to eat foods high in its content or take dietary supplements containing it. As a building block for protein, amino acids like L-lysine are necessary for normal growth and development. In particular, L-lysine is needed by the body to manufacture carnitine, a substance that is used in the conversion of fatty acids into energy.

915593	5117497	0.24808502	Temperature is a gauge of how thoroughly cooked a cut of meat is based on the color, juiciness and internal temperature when cooked. The gradations of cooking are most often used in reference to beef (especially steak and roasts) but are also applicable to lamb, pork, poultry, veal and seafood (especially fish).he whole meat and the center will also continue to cook slightly as the hot exterior continues to warm the comparatively cooler interior. The exception is if the meat has been prepared in a sous-vide process, as it will already be at temperature equilibrium.
