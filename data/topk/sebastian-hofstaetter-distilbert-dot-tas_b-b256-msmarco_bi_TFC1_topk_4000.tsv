The presence of introns is thought to assist gene regulation by way of complex methods like alternative splicing. After splicing, a 5' cap and a poly(A) tail are added, and this 'final draft' is called mature mRNA. Splicing, capping, and tailing comprise RNA processing in the nucleus. Once the mature mRNA moves into the cytoplasm, it begins translation and undergoes other forms of gene regulation.

TSH is produced when the hypothalamus releases a substance called thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH). TRH then triggers the pituitary gland to release TSH.TSH causes the thyroid gland to make two hormones: triiodothyronine (T3) and thyroxine (T4). T3 and T4 help control your body's metabolism.

The needles may be long or short or somewhere in between, but if you find needles in bundles, you have a pine tree.

The influence of Etruscan art on the Romans was supreme from the 6th century BC until the ascendancy of Greek styles in the 3rd century BC. See also Greek Art and Architecture; Roman Art and Architecture. Etruscan art reveals its relation to that of the Greeks, (in both Greece and southern Italy) and to that of Egypt and Asia Minor. It also exhibits Italian elements and reflects distinctively Etruscan religious beliefs. Etruscan art had great influence on subsequent Roman styles. etruscans	define etruscans	2

It is a bright white pigment with excellent covering power. replacements	what metal are hip replacements made of	3

These studies did not consider the underlying cause of the fevers, however, so there are questions about whether the cause for concern is the fever itself or whatever is causing the fever, such as an infection. miscarriage	can fever cause miscarriage early pregnancy	3

Since the pituitary senses too much thyroid hormone, it stops secreting TSH. In spite of this the thyroid gland continues to grow and make thyroid hormone. Therefore, Graves’ disease produces a goiter and hyperthyroidism. goiter can occur in a gland that is producing too much hormone (hyperthyroidism), too little hormone (hypothyroidism), or the correct amount of hormone (euthyroidism). A goiter indicates there is a condition present which is causing the thyroid to grow abnormally.	However, TSI also stimulates the thyroid to make too much thyroid hormone (causes hyperthyroidism).

An exon is any part of a gene that will become a part of the final mature RNA produced by that gene after introns have been removed by RNA splicing. The term exon refers to both the DNA sequence within a gene and to the corresponding sequence in RNA transcripts. In RNA splicing, introns are removed and exons are covalently joined to one another as part of generating the mature messenger RNA.	For other uses, see Exon (disambiguation).

Therefore, L-lysine, also called lysine, is considered as one of the eight essential amino acids. In order to obtain lysine, one has to eat foods high in its content or take dietary supplements containing it. As a building block for protein, amino acids like L-lysine are necessary for normal growth and development. In particular, L-lysine is needed by the body to manufacture carnitine, a substance that is used in the conversion of fatty acids into energy.

Most thyroid nodules are not cancer and do not cause problems. Many don't even need treatment. Sometimes a thyroid nodule can cause problems. Sometimes a nodule can make too much thyroid hormone. When a nodule makes too much hormone, the rest of the gland is suppressed and doesn't work as hard as usual. Most thyroid nodules are not cancerous. But if tests show cancer, surgery will be done to remove the nodule. What causes thyroid nodules? It is not clear what causes thyroid nodules. But people who have been exposed to radiation have a greater chance of getting them. Thyroid nodules are more common as you age. Also, the nodules tend to run in families.	What are thyroid nodules?
