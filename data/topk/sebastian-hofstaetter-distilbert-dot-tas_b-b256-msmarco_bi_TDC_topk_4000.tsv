Sugars are conducted throughout the plant in the phloem, water and other nutrients through the xylem. Conduction occurs from a source to a sink for each separate nutrient. Vascular plants have vascular tissues which distribute resources through the plant. 2  This feature allows vascular plants to evolve to a larger size than non-vascular plants, which lack these specialized conducting tissues and are therefore restricted to relatively small sizes.

These cells are dead when they are functioning and that function is to transport water through the plant.(Remember that water movement occurs by Transpiration-Cohesion-Tension).hloem is a living tissue, composed of sieve tube cells, and its primary function is to transport nutrients (in sap) throughout the plant. As opposed to xylem which only transports water up the plant, phloem transports nutrients up or down, depending on where the nutrients are greatest.

In plate tectonics, a convergent boundary, also known as a destructive plate boundary (because of subduction), is an actively deforming region where two (or more) tectonic plates or fragments of the lithosphere move toward one another and collide.s a result of pressure, friction, and plate material melting in the mantle, earthquakes and volcanoes are common near convergent boundaries. When two plates move towards one another, they form either a subduction zone or a continental collision. This depends on the nature of the plates involved.	From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia.

Red marrow contains stem cells, unspecialized cells that can grow into different types of specialized cells. They're responsible for replenishing and replacing cells in the body that have been damaged or lost.f the body needs more blood cells, yellow marrow can transform back into red marrow and produce them. Some bones have a lot more red marrow than others -- the pelvic bone, the spine's vertebrae and our ribs are all rich with it. The body also stores iron in bone marrow.

A deal in which the car is sold for $12,500 would be Pareto efficient because both the seller and the buyer are better off as a result of the trade. In this case, they are better off by the same amount: $2,500. However, any price between $10,000 and $15,000 is Pareto efficient because the seller receives more value in money than the value he places on the car, and the buyer values the car more than the money he pays for it. Pareto efficiency has applications in game theory, multicriteria decisionmaking, engineering, and many of the social sciences. It is a central principle in economics. In general, an economic allocation problem has several possible Pareto efficient outcomes. In the marketplace, the competitive equilibrium is typically included among them.

You may also occasionally see a 10 baht note, although those are no longer printed.Baht are further broken down into satang, and there are 100 satang per baht.ver the past decade, the baht has fluctuated somewhere between 30 baht per dollar and 42 baht per dollar. In Thailand there are 1 baht, 2 baht, 5 baht and 10 baht coins and 20 baht, 50 baht, 100 baht and 1,000 baht notes. daily	what is the daily life of thai people	3

An intron is any nucleotide sequence within a gene that is removed by RNA splicing during maturation of the final RNA product. The term intron refers to both the DNA sequence within a gene and the corresponding sequence in RNA transcripts. Sequences that are joined together in the final mature RNA after RNA splicing are exons.	Representation of intron and exons within a simple gene containing a single intron.

L-lysine is an amino acid (a building block of protein) that is essential for health. However, it cannot be manufactured naturally in the human body like other types of amino acids. Therefore, L-lysine, also called lysine, is considered as one of the eight essential amino acids. In order to obtain lysine, one has to eat foods high in its content or take dietary supplements containing it. As a building block for protein, amino acids like L-lysine are necessary for normal growth and development. In particular, L-lysine is needed by the body to manufacture carnitine, a substance that is used in the conversion of fatty acids into energy.

Tissue granulation is a process by which fibrous tissue rich with blood capillaries replaces blood clots formed at the site of a healing wound. Through this process, healthy and normal skin is able to replace skin that was damaged.The tissue that forms over a wound during this process is called granulation tissue.The tissue that forms usually has a light pink color and a relatively rough texture; it is also quite moist and tends to be bumpy in appearance.issue granulation occurs in the proliferative phase, during which new, healthy tissue reforms and rebuilds the area of the wound. The final phase of wound healing is the remodeling phase, when the new tissue fully integrates with the old tissue.	These 10 animal facts will amaze you.

Bronchioles are approximately 1mm or less in diameter and their walls consist of ciliated cuboidal epithelium and a layer of smooth muscle. Bronchioles divide into even smaller bronchioles, called terminal, which are 0.5mm or less in diameter.he diameter of the bronchioles plays an important role in air flow. The bronchioles change diameter to either increase or reduce air flow. An increase in diameter is called bronchodilation and is stimulated by either epinephrine or sympathetic nerves to increase air flow.
