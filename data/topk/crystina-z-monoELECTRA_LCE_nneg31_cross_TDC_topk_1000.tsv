118440	3683466	6.3823843	A blood and marrow stem cell transplant replaces a person's abnormal stem cells with healthy ones from another person (a donor). This procedure allows the recipient to get new stem cells that work properly.Stem cells are found in bone marrow, a sponge-like tissue inside the bones.Stem cells develop into the three types of blood cells that the body needs: 1  Red blood cells, which carry oxygen through the body. 2  White blood cells, which fight infection. 3  Platelets (PLATE-lets), which help the blood clot.mall numbers of stem cells also are found in the blood and in the umbilical cord (the cord that connects a fetus to its mother's placenta). Another type of stem cell, called an embryonic (em-bre-ON-ik) stem cell, can develop into any type of cell in the body. These cells aren't found in bone marrow.

Hydrogen is found in large amounts in giant gas planets and stars, it plays a key role in powering stars through fusion reactions.Hydrogen is one of two important elements found in water (H 2 O). Each molecule of water is made up of two hydrogen atoms bonded to one oxygen atom.In 1766, during an acid metal reaction, Henry Cavendish first formally recognized hydrogen.In 1781 he also found that hydrogen produces water when burned.ydrogen can exist as a liquid under high pressure and an extremely low temperature of 20.28 kelvin (−252.87°C, −423.17 °F).

By comparison, a liter of air weighs 1.29 grams, 14 times as much as a liter of hydrogen. Hydrogen changes from a gas to a liquid at a temperature of -252.77°C (-422.99°F) and from a liquid to a solid at a temperature of -259.2°C (-434.6°F). It is slightly soluble in water, alcohol, and a few other common liquids.	Hydrogen is a colorless, odorless, tasteless gas. Its density is the lowest of any chemical element, 0.08999 grams per liter.

During transcription, the entire gene is copied into a pre-mRNA, which includes exons and introns. During the process of RNA splicing, introns are removed and exons joined to form a contiguous coding sequence.
