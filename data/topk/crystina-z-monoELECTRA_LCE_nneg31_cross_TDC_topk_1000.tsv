Bone marrow stem cells turn into red blood cells, white blood cells, or platelets to help your body stay healthy. If your bone marrow is damaged or destroyed, it can no longer make normal blood cells. In a stem cell transplant, healthy stem cells are placed in your body through an IV to help your bone marrow start to work right. When the stem cells come from another person, it is called an allogeneic transplant.	Most stem cells are in your bone marrow. You also have some that circulate from your marrow into your blood.

The fruit is a large, shaped like a football, varying in length from 6-9 inches depending of the cultivar. The skin is thick and woody with a russet brown scruffy surface. The pulp of a mature fruit is salmon pink to red, soft and smooth in texture. The flavor is a sweet, almond like, unique flavor. The fruit will weigh from 1 to 6 pounds. The mamey sapote is usually eaten fresh by hand or to make milkshakes or ice cream. It is also excellent for use in jellies, pastes and conserves.

A gene is a DNA sequence that contains genetic information for one functional protein. Proteins are essential for the modulation and maintenance of cellular activities.	Premessenger RNA has a base sequence identical to the DNA coding strand. Genes consist of sequences encoding mRNA (exons) that are interrupted by non-coding sequences of variable length, called introns. Introns are removed and exons joined together before translation begins in a process called mRNA splicing.he process by which DNA achieves its control of cell life and function through protein synthesis is called gene expression.

If a traditional well done shoulder is desired, it should be cooked at 155°F or 68.3°C. No matter what temperature range is used, the pork shoulder should be cooked for 1 to 2 days. For a crisp or well done outer part, sous vide pork shoulder may be finished by searing, grilling or torching.

Bluetooth and Wi-Fi are both methods that provide wireless communication, but the difference between the two mainly stems from what they are designed to do and how they are used. The main difference is that Bluetooth is primarily used to connect devices without using cables, while Wi-Fi provides high-speed access to the internet. Bluetooth is a wireless technology standard that is used to exchange data over short distances (less than 30 feet), usually between personal mobile devices.
