For example, a 54-year-old man with a titanium dental implant and four titanium screws in his vertebra was so sick that he could not work. typical dental implant is made of pure titanium and/or a titanium alloy. In fact, titanium alloys are widely used in both medicine and dentistry, for dental implants, pacemakers, stents, orthodontal brackets, and orthopedic implants (e.g., hip, shoulder, knee, or elbow).
