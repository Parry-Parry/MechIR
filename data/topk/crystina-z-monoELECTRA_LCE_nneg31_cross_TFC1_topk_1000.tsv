The prevalence of CP is approximately 2 per 1,000 live births. The different types of CP vary from series to series, with the spastic type being the most frequent, while periventricular leukomalacia and/or cortical/cerebral atrophy represents the main neuropathological correlates [1]. dysarthria	types of dysarthria from cerebral palsy	1

A deal in which the car is sold for $12,500 would be Pareto efficient because both the seller and the buyer are better off as a result of the trade. In this case, they are better off by the same amount: $2,500. However, any price between $10,000 and $15,000 is Pareto efficient because the seller receives more value in money than the value he places on the car, and the buyer values the car more than the money he pays for it. Pareto efficiency has applications in game theory, multicriteria decisionmaking, engineering, and many of the social sciences. It is a central principle in economics. In general, an economic allocation problem has several possible Pareto efficient outcomes. In the marketplace, the competitive equilibrium is typically included among them.

451602	1897978	2.7256866	CPAP is a treatment that uses mild air pressure to keep your breathing airways open. Overview It involves using a CPAP machine that includes a mask or other device that fits over your nose or your nose and mouth, straps to position the mask, a tube that connects the mask to the machine’s motor, and a motor that blows air into the tube. CPAP is used to treat sleep-related breathing disorders including sleep apnea. It also may be used to treat preterm infants who have underdeveloped lungs. If your doctor prescribes CPAP over other treatment options for your sleep apnea, your insurance will work with a medical device company to provide you with a CPAP machine and the disposable mask and tube. Your doctor will set up your machine with certain pressure settings.	CPAP is a treatment that uses mild air pressure to keep your breathing airways open.

It is important to know that the presence of a goiter does not necessarily mean that the thyroid gland is malfunctioning. A goiter can occur in a gland that is producing too much hormone (hyperthyroidism), too little hormone (hypothyroidism), or the correct amount of hormone (euthyroidism). A goiter indicates there is a condition present which is causing the thyroid to grow abnormally.	The term “goiter” simply refers to the abnormal enlargement of the thyroid gland.

Bronchioles are approximately 1mm or less in diameter and their walls consist of ciliated cuboidal epithelium and a layer of smooth muscle. Bronchioles divide into even smaller bronchioles, called terminal, which are 0.5mm or less in diameter.he diameter of the bronchioles plays an important role in air flow. The bronchioles change diameter to either increase or reduce air flow. An increase in diameter is called bronchodilation and is stimulated by either epinephrine or sympathetic nerves to increase air flow. type	what type of tissue are bronchioles	3

Most thyroid nodules are not cancer and do not cause problems. Many don't even need treatment. Sometimes a thyroid nodule can cause problems. Sometimes a nodule can make too much thyroid hormone. When a nodule makes too much hormone, the rest of the gland is suppressed and doesn't work as hard as usual. Most thyroid nodules are not cancerous. But if tests show cancer, surgery will be done to remove the nodule. What causes thyroid nodules? It is not clear what causes thyroid nodules. But people who have been exposed to radiation have a greater chance of getting them. Thyroid nodules are more common as you age. Also, the nodules tend to run in families.	What are thyroid nodules?
