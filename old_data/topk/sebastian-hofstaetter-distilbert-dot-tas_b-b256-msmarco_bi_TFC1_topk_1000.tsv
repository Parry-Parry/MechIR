Legionnaires' disease is not contagious, and you cannot catch it from another person. The bacteria are common and grow in water.People often receive low-level exposure in the environment without getting sick. Unlike Legionnaires disease, which can be a serious and deadly form of pneumonia, Pontiac fever produces flu-like symptoms that may include fever, headache, tiredness, loss of appetite, muscle and joint pain, chills, nausea, and a dry cough. 2  Full recovery occurs in 2 to 5 days without antibiotics.
